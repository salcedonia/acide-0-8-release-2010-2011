//	FOR DEVELOPERS	 //
//------------------------------//

For developers who are going to use Eclipse for the development of ACIDE:
The class com.thoughtworks.xstream.converters.reflection.Sun14ReflectionProvider is going to 
throw an error like The type [X] is not accessible due to restriction on required library [Y].

In order to fix it you will have to configure the compilance settings of Eclipse to set that
kind of exceptions like warnings and not as errors:
	--> Deprecated and restricted API		
	--> Forbidden reference --> Warning
